<h2>Erechtheus (Ἐρεχθεύς)/Erichthonius (Ἐριχθόνιος)</h2>
<h3>King of Athens</h3>

<p>Erechtheus was born of the Earth and Hephaestus. His birth story begins with Hephaestus being infatuated by Athena. Athena, being a goddess of virtue and maidenhood, refused his advances. Born from the earth - Autochthonous (Gaia). Raised by Athena. Bottom-half reptile.</p>
<p>Erechtheus became the first king of Athens and Athena, being both his mother figure and patron god of Athens, frequently protected him. He made a statue in her honor. He is snake.
    Credited as first maker of the chariot on occasion though usually Athena. Would have made it to compensate for his bad legs
    Poseidon Erechtheus epithet.
    </p>
<p>Mention Kekrops. (Also founder king and half snake) Chose Athena’s gift over Poseidon. Spring is called Erechtheis. This version still has Ere (with a U) but he shows up later in myth, not being the first king, and everything else is pretty much the same (At this point in mythology however he is distinctly called Eri and not Ere, which he was first.)</p>
<p>Referred to as both Erechtheus and Erichthonius. Original mythos Erechtheus (most commonly known). For a long time was referred to as either. Eventually with the addition of Kekrops, he was solidly referred to as Eri.</p>
