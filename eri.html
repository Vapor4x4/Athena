<h2>Erechtheus (Ἐρεχθεύς)/Erichthonius (Ἐριχθόνιος)</h2>
<h3>King of Athens</h3>
</div>

<div class="eretext">
<p>Erechtheus was born of the Earth and Hephaestus. His birth story begins with Hephaestus being infatuated by Athena. Athena, being a goddess of virtue and maidenhood, refused his advances. Some of his semen landed on her thigh, which she then wiped away with a piece of wool, and it landed on the ground. From this, Erechtheus was born from the earth (Gaia), making him autochthonous – meaning born from the earth. As Gaia is the mother of monsters, Erectheus is no exception, having his bottom-half be that of a reptile. Despite her refusal of Hephaestus, Athena raised Erechtheus as though he was her son.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Erechtheus became the first king of Athens. Athena, being both his mother figure and patron god of Athens frequently protected him. He made a statue in her honor. In the statue of Athena Parthenos he is represented by the snake that is under Athena’s shield, showing their connection.
    In some mythos, he is occasionally credited as the first maker of the chariot, though it is most commonly represented and accepted to have been created by Athena. His reason in making the chariot would have been to compensate for his bad legs due to his reptile half. This connects him back to his father Hephaestus, who has a crippling disability.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>A different version of the mythos of Athens’ founding introduces Kekrops, another first king of Athens and half reptile. He was the one who chose Athena’s gift over Poseidon’s in the founding of Athens. The spring was called Erechtheis (with an I, not a U). This version of the myth still has Erechtheus, however he shows up much later. This time being a king of Athens, just not the first, having to gain the position by overthrowing Amphictyon, with everything else about the mythos reamining pretty much the same. Though at this point in mythology he is distinctly called Erichthonius and not Erechtheus.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the original mythos his name is Erechtheus, and he is most commonly referred to by that name. Overtime he began to be referred to as Erichthonius and for a time both names would be used interchangeably. However, by the time the mythos of Kekrops was introduced, Erechtheus had been solidified as Erichthonius.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>There is also an epithet of Poseiden called Poseidon Erechtheus. This connects the two characters through the story of Athens' founding due to the spring named Erechtheis.
